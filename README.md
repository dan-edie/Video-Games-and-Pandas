An introduction to Pandas

This project acts as an introduction to Pandas. There are two different projects based on differing datasets.
I chose to start with the data based on information from a video game company. Our task was to perform different
analysis, such as gender demographics, ages, and top spenders. For each analysis, a dataframe table was generated.

Having experience with Pandas, I found some new and better ways to pull and call data than I had in the past. One
of the joys I find in programming and data analysis is always finding these better methods and continuing to become
better at creating clean code. It is something that I feel cannot be mastered, but the challenge is to strive for 
that level of knowledge.

Next steps:
- Work on the second data set
